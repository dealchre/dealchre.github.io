#Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
#`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

#Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
