#Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
#`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

#Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

This project aims to understand how residents of rural communities perceive and react to extreme weather impacts, how these perceptions influence extreme weather response and adaptation, and to characterize the interdependence of community and agricultural extreme weather impacts.

For this research project we aim to interview and survey members in the community. If you would like to participate please contact us at chavezd@ksu.edu.
