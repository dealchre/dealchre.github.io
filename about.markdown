My name is Denise Chavez. I am PhD student in the Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences at Kansas State University, I am a member of the  [SCALes Lab] (https://scales-ksu.netlify.app/) and work under the supervion of [Dr. Katherine Nelson] (https://www.k-state.edu/geography/about/people/faculty/nelson.html). My research attempts to assess Kansas rural communitiesâ€™ response and adaptation to extreme weather events. I believe that by understanding the interdependence and cascading impacts between farms and rural communities, and vice-versa we can develop more effective policies and interventions to support communities' resilience and sustainability. My hope throughout my research is to contribute to a healthier and stronger society by advocating for policy change and community education opportunities.
